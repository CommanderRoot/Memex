 Status of work

  Branches:
  Working on filter-query-logic currently
  Other work is on header branch. This is ready to merge now that I've shifted the
   filter logic work to the top level dir


 Direction of work

 Query filter logic misc
 1. Build out logic to control states
 2. Test end to end
    a. String to object and back to string
    b. Object to string and back to object

 Where I'm leaving things Monday 4.1.21
 Test data is all built
 Parsing is working fine with all tests passed
 Construction is failing all tests with the returned value 'Function Anonymous'
 Manual spot testing of construction logic shows it's working as expected
 Haven't yet built testing logic for filter updated

 Filter Updates
 Most of the heavy lifting is done but need to build top-level function to receive mutations
  and return updated query string (? - could return something else but brain is fried)

 Cursor Position
 Already built into test data
 Need to build event handler to sync picker state (isOpen) and cursor position
  - bi-directional: both on cursor position change and on picker open

 Misc:
 X 1. Integrate changes from lists-sidebar-group PR
 2. Integrate feedback from Figma
  - Sidebar hide behaviour
  - Searchbar debounce of 500ms before search
 3. Add link to SSM Contact Support anchor
 4. Refactor DateRangeSelection component to styled-components
 5. Change search bar 'Close Filters' button to have 3 states as per figma comment
